## Section 1: Geo-processing and Overlay Analysis

Tutorial name(s) and link(s):

-   Â [Predict Deforestation in the Amazon Rain Forest](https://learn.arcgis.com/en/projects/predict-deforestation-in-the-amazon-rain-forest/#finish-and-print-the-map) (Approx 1 hour)

Insight: ArcGIS provides and extensive array of tools and processes to combine and join data in many ways, there is almost always a 'best' tool for the job since many are specifically designed for a specific purpose. Taking the time to understand you current features, your question, and what you need to to answer you question can save you a huge headache later.

### Statements of Understanding

-   Create a new feature class from a selection (This is an important skill that you will use many times).

    -   Right click feature, 'Data', 'Export Features'

-   Find linear units of measure for a coordinate system.

    -   Calculate Geometry tool (analysis tool)

-   Calculate fields in the attribute table.

    -   Open att. table, 'calculate field', can use python here.

-   Use Trace in the editing tools.

    -   The snapping section of this tutorial was great, would've been nice to understand when we did the girls camp challenge.

## Section 2: Data Sources

Knowing where to find and download geospatial data can be a big challenge. In this section, list the internet data sources that you use during the semester and any others that you encounter on your own.

-   ESRI Tutorial Download

## Section 3: Class How To's

In this section include documents provided in class (e.g., how to prepare a table for use in GIS, how to georeference) or notes about a specific tool you learn about that's not part of the assigned topics.
