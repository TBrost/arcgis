If I am unable to find a demand layer that also has centroids, I will need to calculate them using the calculate geometry tool.\nFrom there I will need to import my demand points, exisiting features, and network.\n\nWill a geoprocessing model (W05) help you organize, execute, and present the sub-steps? If it makes sense, build the model.\nI honestly don’t know if the geoprocessing models fit into the network analysis framework. I think they would be used more in creating the objects passed to the network tools."

(Week 4)\n\nI don’t think so\n\nAre there attributes you need to derive using ‘Calculate Fields’ or ‘Calculate Geometery?’\n\nProbably, I will likely need to calculate centroids for the regions in my demand class.\n\nDo you need a DEM? (Week 9)\n\nNo\n\nDo you need to use the editing tools to create the data? (W03)\n\nNo, unless I am unable to find a relatively up-to-date point class for my existing features.\n\nDo you need to georeference any raster maps and then use the editing tools? (W08)\n\nNo.\n\nAre any of the data output from a geoprocessing step (i.e., secondary data)?\n\nYes, Centroids and the data they come from will be aggregate counts and sums of the areas they represent."

Will you need to create any of the data?\nYou don’t need to find all the data yet, but you might want to try doing a web search for the data you need. Make your search specific to what you are looking for and be sure to include in the search phrase one of these terms: geospatial, GIS, shapefile, or kml. (Kml files are used by Google Earth and can be converted into feature classes using Data Management Tools in ArcGIS Pro. An example is ldstemples.kml.) If you can’t find what you need do you need to revise your question or create your own data?\nA few sources that have a variety of spatial datasets:\n\nUS data: Geospatial Data Gateway, NationalMap.gov, National Park Service data, National Transportation Database, etc. Most federal agencies as well as state, county, and city governments maintain a geospatial data repository. To find the data type the political name, the data you want (e.g., counties) and ‘geospatial data’ into a search engine. ESRI data portal.\niNaturalist (You need to create an account and use the Export tool to get the data.)\nNon-US data: Many countries have good spatial data repositories. The ESRI data portal and Living Atlas are other excellent resources for non-US data. However, sometimes these ESRI data sets cannot be altered, if this is the case, try to select it and then export it to a new feature class.\nCreate data if needed by georeferencing, editing, joining attribute tables, etc.\nYour personal list of data sources that you have kept through the semester.\nI-Learn has another link that may be useful.\n\nFor the type of data I will need, I expect most if not all of it to be available through ESRI’s living atlas and the portal. If I’m not able to find what I need, I’ll need to simplify my approach and maybe just expand on the efforts of the data provided as part of the official tutorial."
