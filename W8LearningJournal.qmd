Common Projections and their aspects.

\
**Define Projection vs Project:**

-   What is the difference between the ArcGIS Pro tools 'Define Projection' and 'Project?'

    -   Define projection is used for data with no coordinate system or with an incorrect coordinate system

    -   Project is used to convert data that has a correct coordinate system but when you want to change it to another coordinate system

-   Which tool do you use if the data are missing spatial reference?

    -   Define projection

-   Which would you use if you want to transform data from a geographic to a projected coordinate system?

    -   Project

-   Which tool overwrites a data set? Which creates a copy of the dataset?

    -   Define projection overwrites, project creates a copy

**Projecting a map vs Projecting Data:**

-   What is the difference between projecting a map and projecting data?

    -   Projecting a map is the math to convert a sphere into a flat 2d representation

    -   Projecting data is setting/changing the coordinate system of data based on a map projection formula

-   Which one requires a tool?

    -   Projecting data requires the project tool in ArcGIS

-   Which one changes how the map looks but leaves the data alone?

    -   Projecting a map will change the look of a map but not the datas positions relative to the map. 

-   What is the difference between a projected and a geographic coordinate system?

    -   A PCS has linear units and a projection type, a GCS has angular units, a prime meridian, a datum and a spheroid.
