Geo Referenced utilities map

**\
Benefits of Georeferencing and Schema for DeSoto County:**

-   **Decision Making and Planning:** With the ability to visualize utility locations on a map, engineers can make informed decisions about maintenance, upgrades, and future planning. Additionally this data can be joined with other GIS data for increased breadth of analysis.

-   **Enhanced Public Safety:** Knowing the location of utilities is crucial for emergency responders like firefighters in case of emergencies.

-   **Reduced Costs:** Having a centralized and organized system can minimize wasted time searching for physical copies of maps and potentially reduce errors in locating utilities during excavation projects.

**Schema for Digitizing the Map:**

-   **Feature Type:** This specifies the type of utility (water main, sewer line, etc.)

-   **Diameter:** Pipe diameter for the utility line.

-   **Material:** Material the pipe is constructed from (PVC, cast iron, etc.)

-   **Installation Date:** Year the utility was installed.

-   **Depth:** Estimated depth of the utility line.
